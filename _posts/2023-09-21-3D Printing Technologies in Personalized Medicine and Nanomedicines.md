3D printing technologies have made significant advancements in the fields of personalized medicine, nanomedicines, and biopharmaceuticals, offering innovative solutions for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the production of customized medical devices. 

3D printing technologies in medicine allow for the customization of treatments to meet individual patient needs. Several 3D printing methods are employed, including nozzle-based extrusion, laser-writing systems, and powder binder jetting. These techniques have diverse applications, including solid and semi-solid medicines, medical devices, and locally applied treatments.

For solid dosage forms, 3D printing can combine multiple drugs in a single form, improving patient compliance, ease of swallowing, and control over drug release. It can also create new medicines when no suitable dosage form exists. Additionally, sustained-release implants and devices are used in joint replacements, prostheses, and cardiovascular therapies. Locally applied medicines like wound dressings, microneedles, and medicated contact lenses can also be produced using 3D printing.

Selecting the appropriate 3D printing technique and developing pharmaceutical inks with the required properties are key challenges. The integration of biopharmaceuticals and nanotechnology with 3D printing, often referred to as "nanoprinting," holds promise for personalized nanomedicines in the future. Continuous manufacturing using 3D-printed microfluidic chips may further enhance the translation of these innovations into clinical practice.

Here's an overview of how 3D printing is impacting these areas:

## **Personalized Medicine**

Personalized medicine tailors treatments based on individuals' genotypes, lifestyles, and medical data. It aims to improve treatment effectiveness, reduce healthcare costs, and prevent diseases. Various terms like precision medicine and genomic medicine describe the same concept 3D printing is a powerful tool for creating custom medicines and medical devices. It can produce tablets, metallic prostheses, and nanomedicines tailored to patient needs.

**3D Printing of Medicines**
3D printing, a process of layering 2D sheets to create 3D objects, is gaining popularity due to its versatility and cost-effectiveness. It offers precise customization of pharmacological therapies to suit individual patient needs.

### **Applications in Healthcare**

3D printing has diverse applications, including printing medicines (topical, oral, and parenteral forms), personalized implants, and prostheses. It also explores 4D printing, where implants can change shape over time within the patient's body. In tissue engineering, 3D printing creates scaffolds for 3D cell cultures and organ-on-a-chip models that closely mimic human tissues, reducing the need for animal testing. Microfluidic chips produced using 3D printing support cell growth and nanomedicine production.

### **Technical Considerations for 3D Printing Medicines:**

To 3D print medicines, design the structure using CAD software or obtain it from a 3D scanner. Slice the design into layers, generating a g-code file for the printer. Specific printing techniques require suitable materials. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) requires a flexible filament with the drug. Stereolithography (SLA) uses a photopolymerizable resin mixed with the active ingredient exposed to UV light. Other techniques, like semisolid extrusion (SSE), employ semiviscous mixtures of active ingredients and excipients in prefilled syringes deposited on the printer platform. Proper drug stability throughout printing is crucial for solid dosage forms.

### **Challenges to Bringing 3D Printing Technology to Clinical Practice**

One major challenge is the time it takes to 3D print medicines, ranging from 7 seconds to 15 minutes, which is much slower than traditional tablet presses capable of producing millions of tablets per hour.

Cost is another hurdle, as meeting stringent quality standards raises the price of 3D-printed medicines. This includes implementing effective decontamination protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Currently, only one GMP-compliant 3D printer for medicines, M3DIMAKER, is available at a cost of approximately EUR 80,000. FabRx has addressed cross-contamination concerns by incorporating printing within blister packaging.

Selecting pharmaceutical-grade excipients with clear audit trails limits manufacturing options. Regulatory and ethical handling of these products is still evolving, and standard pharmacopoeia tests like disintegration may be challenging for 3D-printed solid dosage forms.

Training healthcare professionals in 3D printing is crucial, despite the increasing availability of 3D printers in households. Ensuring quality standards requires expertise and knowledge, necessitating suitable training at points-of-care for successful clinical implementation of this technology.

### **Differences Between Conventional Drug Manufacturing and 3D Printing:**

**Conventional Drug Manufacturing:**

### **3D Printing in Personalized Biopharmaceuticals**

The application of 3D printing in biopharmaceuticals is gaining traction, offering innovative possibilities in precision medicine. While most 3D printing research has focused on small molecules, the burgeoning biopharmaceutical market is exploring new avenues, particularly in personalized organ-on-chip manufacturing. This involves peptides and proteins, with applications in tissue engineering, such as cartilage and bone regeneration. Combining biopharmaceuticals with cell-based scaffolds has demonstrated enhanced tissue growth. Examples include bilayered porous scaffolds for cartilage and subchondral regeneration and PLA scaffolds promoting osteogenesis.

Hydrogels play a crucial role, eliminating the need for heating during printing, but their rheological properties pose challenges. Hence, a common approach is combining PAM with FDM printing to create mechanically robust scaffolds using biocompatible polymers. Peptide hydrogel design involves optimizing the amphiphilic balance of the backbone sequence to enable physical gelation driven by interactions like H-bonding, charge–charge interactions, and π–π stacking.

Innovations also extend to 3D-printed solid dosage forms with biopharmaceuticals. For instance, tablets with specific release profiles have been developed, and polymeric microneedle patches loaded with insulin show promise in transdermal delivery. Moreover, multiunit implants enable remote light-controlled protein drug delivery through near-infrared light-induced release, demonstrating efficacy in diabetic mouse models. These advancements highlight the potential of 3D printing in biopharmaceuticals, particularly with the resilience of peptides in material extrusion techniques.

## **Nanomedicine and 3D Printing**

Nanomedicine utilizes nanomaterials for diagnosis, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine due to their unique properties. Inorganic and organic nanoparticles are widely used, with liposomes being common in cancer treatment. Flexible transferosomes are used for topical drug delivery, and self-nanoemulsifying systems (SNEDDS) enhance drug solubility. Polymeric nanoparticles are researched for tumor targeting.

3D printing is transforming nanomedicine manufacturing. Challenges include nanoparticle aggregation, but preprocessing techniques can improve homogeneity. 3D-printed solid dosage forms, including polyphenols and liposomes, show promise in drug delivery. Metallic implants and medical devices are also customized through 3D printing.

**Scaling Up Nanomedicine Production:**

Conventional methods like solvent evaporation have limitations in scaling up nanomedicine production due to solvent removal challenges and lack of control over drug polymorphism. Continuous manufacturing, despite its potential, faces challenges like batch-to-batch reproducibility and stability issues.

Microfluidic devices offer precise control and automation, but traditional fabrication methods face obstacles. 3D printing overcomes these issues, allowing high-throughput nanomedicine synthesis with tunable properties. It provides an advantage over batch production.

**Challenges and Future Perspectives:**

3D printing in personalized medicine holds vast potential but faces slow clinical translation due to complexity, regulatory issues, and cost. Standard 3D printers may not meet regulatory standards, and high-quality GMP printers are expensive. Healthcare personnel need proper training to ensure quality standards and minimize variability.

Regulatory bodies like the FDA, EMA, and PMDA should collaborate on clear guidelines for 3D-printed medicines. Progress is expected in the next decade, changing the landscape of personalized medicine.
